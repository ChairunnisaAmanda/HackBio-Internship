# Protein-Protein Interaction Networks Analysis: Unlocking Cancer Mechanisms
Authors (@slack): Chairunnisa Amanda (@AmandaC)

Protein-Protein Interaction Networks (PPINs) analysis is an essential tool in modern biology that examines how proteins interact within cells. These interactions result in the formation of multi-protein complexes, which are crucial for various cellular functions (Wodak et al., 2013). Gaining an understanding of PPINs is key to uncovering how cells operate and how diseases develop (Raman, 2010). In the case of cancer, a highly complex disease involving multiple genes, PPIN Analysis becomes especially important. Cancer often arises from disruptions in normal protein interactions, which cause cellular processes that control growth and division to malfunction.

### Understanding Protein-Protein Interaction Networks

PPINs represent the intricate web of interactions between proteins, fundamental to nearly every biological process. By studying PPINs, researchers can infer the functions of unknown proteins based on their interactions with known ones, enabling the modelling of functional pathways that exemplify cellular processes (Rao et al., 2014). PPINs also help identify key proteins, known as hubs, that control critical biological processes. Understanding PPINs, especially in complex diseases like cancer, provides valuable insights into disease mechanisms and aids in developing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. (Safari-Alighiarloo et al., 2014)  
### Importance of PPINs Analysis in Cancer

Cancer often arises from disrupted protein interactions, leading to malfunctioning cellular processes. PPIN analysis provides a comprehensive view of these interactions, helping to uncover the molecular basis of cancer (Safari-Alighiarloo et al., 2014). This approach is essential for identifying abnormal networks and potential biomarkers, crucial for developing targeted therapies (Arkin, 2005).

PPINs analysis is crucial in understanding the roles of tumour suppressors and oncogenes. Another example in prostate cancer, integrating genetic data with PPINs revealed molecular differences between aggressive and non-aggressive forms, highlighting specific proteins as potential therapeutic targets. (Ergün et al., 2007)

PPI Networks help identify key drug targets. A study using the Networked Gene Prioritizer (NGP) method analysed three non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) datasets and found that PLK1, the MCM complex, and SKP2, along with their interacting genes, play significant roles in cancer cell cycles but not in normal cells. These proteins could be promising drug targets for cancer therapy. (Wu et al., 2012)
### Conclusion

Protein-Protein Interaction Network Analysis is a powerful tool for understanding the complex molecular mechanisms of cancer. By focusing on entire networks rather than individual components, PPIN Analysis offers insights that can lead to more effective and targeted therapies. This approach not only enhances our understanding of cancer but also holds promise for improving treatment outcomes in this challenging disease.
